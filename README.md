## Memory Organization Package by Riesbeck and Schank

“MOP” is an acronym of “Memory Organization Package” by Chirstopher K. Riesbeck, and Roger C. Schank in “Inside Case Based Reasoning”. It does not stand for Meta-Object Protocol.

Note that “MOP” or “Mop” here means the system or the proper name, but “mop” means an entity in MOP system. 

MOP has two-fold characteristics, one is to provide the framework of memory-prediction as Jeff Hawkins say, or prediction-schema as Ulric Neisser say. The other is to provide the automated installation of cases into memory that coherently organized. In MOP, the intension decides the extension.

The program Judge.lisp is an example of the automated definition of sentence in the judgment. See the next example program DMAP of MOP for the predictive functionality of memory. 

All of them are modernized as usual fot the current Common Lisp.
